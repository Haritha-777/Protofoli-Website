I have implemented a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The header section is built using the Bootstrap Navbar component to ensure smooth navigation. The Home and About sections are structured 
using CSS Flexbox for effective layout management. The webpage is fully responsive and provides a consistent user experience on both mobile devices and laptops.
